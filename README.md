# FMODSoundBankEditor
A tool for editing FSB4 version FMOD sound banks (.fsb). The application is based around Forza Motorsport 4/Horizon 1's engine FSBs, but may have other uses. Your mileage may vary!

Please back up any files before editing them in this program. There are likely many things that can break the building of a new FMOD bank. This tool was simply made as a quick and dirty way of building banks for my own use and is provided here for research/file format understanding means.

(Lots of hardcoded variables ahead, beware)
